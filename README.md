# Deploying ML Model 

In this project, my goal is to create an end to end ML project and deploy it to production on AWS. 

## How can this help you?  
This can help you if you are trying to: 
- Get understanding of Machine Learning Pipelines
- Understand scikit learn better
- Understand the role of CI and CD pipelines. 
- Understand how you can make use of web frameworks for python such as Flask. 


## Jupyter Notebooks: 

I will first run the pipelines and the model in the jupyter notebooks and then will convert it into production codes.
